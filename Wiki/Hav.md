## Geography

### Location

Hav is located in Soumoa, extending from north western coast along to the eastern coast, borded by the Brooding Sea to the north. To the south lies the disorganized and unclaimed lands of the southern Sounorra.

### Terrain 

The southern border of Hav is characterized by a large mountain range called the Iron Peaks, which separates it from the southern Sounorra. The coastal regions feasure a mix of cold sandy beaches, rocky shores, and cliffs. Inland features dense foress, with some fertile valleys where Hav grows most of its food.

### Key Regions

- **Flord-Clif**: The capital city, located on the north western shore, known for its steep cliffs and scenic views of the Brooding Sea. It serves as the political and economic center of Hav.
- **Monch**: A small coastal town known for its fishing industry, located on the far south. Monch is considered by many to be the end of the world, as it is the last settlement before the unclaimed lands of the southern Sounorra.
- **Iron Peaks**: A mountain range forming the southern border, rich in minerals but difficult to traverse.

## Climate

 Post-Drift climate with short, mild summers and extremely cold, snowy winters. Many speculate that Hav will be the last place on Yanorra to burn in the heat death of Yanorra.

## History

### Pre-Drift Era (~500,000 cycles ago, ~1,369 Earth years)

Hav was a sparsely populated region, primarily inhabited by nomadic tribes who relied on hunting and gathering. As neighboring S'Tsutodo to north searched for alternative food sources, they discovered the fertile valleys of Hav. 

S'Tsutodo's expansion into Hav, however, caused conflict with the indigenous tribes, leading to a series of skirmishes. Ronobetu wanted to expand its influence in the region, while forcing S'Tsutodo to rely more on Ronobetu for food, so they supported the tribes in their resistance against S'Tsutodo.

Two hundred years before The Drift, Hav officially became a protectorate of Ronobetu, which established trade routes and military outposts to secure its interests in the region. This led to increased stability and the development of Hav's agricultural practices, particularly in the fertile valleys.

### The Drift (~146,100 cycles ago, ~400 Earth years)

After The Drift, many states adopted isolationist policies to protect their resources and populations. Hav, cut off from Ronobetu due to the Brooding Sea's dangers, focused on self-sufficiency and local governance.

S'Tsutodo's, desperate for food, attempted to reassert control over Hav, but the indigenous tribes, now more organized were able to resist.

Instead, Hav's leaders declared independence, establishing a loose confederation of tribes and settlements. This confederation quickly normalized trade with S'Tsutodo, exchanging agricultural goods for manufactured items and technology.
