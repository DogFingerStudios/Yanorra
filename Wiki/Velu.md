## History

### Pre-Drift Era (~500,000 cycles ago, ~1,369 Earth years)

Velu flourished as a cornerstone of East Yanorra’s agriculture, supplying grains, vegetables, and livestock to Duvessa, Bibi Shirif, and the Three Sisters (Totoku, Endotoku, Obetoku). Its fertile plains and river valleys supported a robust economy.

Shortly before The Drift, Erik the Explorer, a legendary Velu navigator, claimed to have crossed the uncharted Eastvoid Ocean, landing on a fertile continent named Anqhara, though it is unclear if he named it or if the people who returned with him did. According to oral mythos, Erik made multiple voyages across the Eastvoid Ocean, returning with settlers -- the Anqaran people -- who introduced advanced irrigation, crop diversification, and ritualistic harvest practices. These Anqaran integrated into Velu’s plains, significantly enhancing its agricultural output. However, skepticism persists, with some scholars arguing Erik’s tales are exaggerated myths and the Anqaran origins are a fabrication to bolster Velu’s prestige.

### The Drift (~146,100 cycles ago, ~400 Earth years)

The Drift rendered the Brooding Sea unnavigable and severed Velu’s direct trade routes with most points in East Yanorra. The Eastvoid Ocean, already treacherous, became inaccessible no more than a few miles offshore, casting further doubt on Erik’s Anqhara voyages. 

Velu’s agricultural surplus, critical for East Yanorra, was rerouted through Duvessa’s Riftlands, a chain of islands that became the sole maritime trade conduit. The Anqaran people, still influential in Velu’s agriculture, helped adapt farming practices to the disrupted climate, while Velu’s economy grew increasingly dependent on Duvessa’s trade infrastructure.

### Post-Drift Era (~145,000–130,000 cycles ago, ~397–356 Earth years)

Velu solidified its agricultural dominance by fortifying Gate Thaurin, transforming it into a heavily guarded trade hub that strictly regulated exports and prohibited immigration to preserve resources. 

The Anqaran people, marginalized by Velu’s centralized policies, were displaced from the fertile plains to the rugged mountains and coastal cliffs. There, they formed insular communities, preserving their unique agricultural techniques and rituals, blending Anqharan traditions with Velu’s culture.

Around 80 centara (~220 Earth years) after The Drift, the Anqaran declared independence, establishing Reddelstone, a small nation in the mountains near near the Velu naval city of Big Bay. Velu’s government, prioritizing agricultural exports, largely ignored Reddelstone, allowing it to develop as an independent, self-sufficient enclave. Velu adopted Anqaran techniques, such as terraced farming and seed preservation, to enhance its output, maintaining its role as a key food supplier to Duvessa, Bibi Shirif, and the Three Sisters. 

Tensions with Duvessa grew due to Duvessa's control over the Riftlands trade route, fostering resentment among Velu’s leaders and the Anqaran diaspora.

### Current Era (~146,100 cycles, ~400 Earth years since The Drift)

Velu remains East Yanorra’s agricultural powerhouse, exporting food to Duvessa, Bibi Shirif, and the Three Sisters. Its strict immigration protect its resources but exacerbate regional tensions, particularly as frustration with Duvessa’s trade monopoly grows. 

Velu stays neutral in Duvessa’s civil war, though its reliance on the Riftlands keeps it entangled in regional dynamics. The Anqaran people, now split between Velu’s coastal cliffs and Reddelstone, maintain their distinct rituals -- such as solstice harvest festivals -- despite ongoing debates about their Anqharan origins and Erik the Explorer’s voyages, which remain unprovable due to the unnavigable Eastvoid Ocean.

Velu has advanced its communication technology, developing a cable-phone system capable of transmitting data across the Virelich Ocean, enabling near-instant contact with Duvessa, Bibi Shirif, and the Three Sisters. Packet radio and shortwave relays connect Velu’s rural farming communities, improving internal coordination. These technologies, shared with other East Yanorra nations, have strengthened regional networks despite post-Drift infrastructure challenges. H

owever, Velu’s insular policies and dependence on Duvessa’s trade routes continue to fuel diplomatic friction, while the Anqaran cultural legacy endures as a point of pride and contention.

## Politics

- **Government**: Unknown structure, but characterized by strict centralized control, particularly over immigration and trade. Gate Thaurin serves as the administrative and military hub.  
- **Foreign Relations**:  
  - **Duvessa**: Reliant on Duvessa’s Riftlands route for exporting agricultural goods, leading to a strained but necessary trade partnership.  
  - **Bibi Shirif and Three Sisters**: Supplies food to these East Yanorra nations, which depend on Velu’s surplus but resent Duvessa’s trade monopoly.  
  - **Ronobetu**: Limited contact post-Drift due to the Brooding Sea’s dangers, with trade now routed through Duvessa.  
- **Key Issues**: Balancing agricultural exports with internal food security, managing immigration pressures, and navigating Duvessa’s trade dominance.

## Economy
