Yanorra - World Overview

# Summary 

* Yanorra is a terrestrial planet in a state of societal and environmental crisis.
* \~400 Earth years (\~146,100 days) ago, a massive celestial object entered the solar system—an event known as **The Drift**.
* The planet was thrown into an unstable elliptical orbit.
* Summers have become shorter and hotter; winters longer and colder. Seasonal lengths are now unpredictable.
* Astronomers are uncertain: the planet may fall into its star or be ejected from its system.
* The Drift stunted global development and triggered long-term societal depression.
* Most people believe extinction is inevitable.

# Planetary Overview

## Yanorra
* Terrestrial, Earth-sized
* Rotational cycle ≈ 1 Earth day
* Yearly cycle = Increasingly unpredictable, no longer follows a fixed calendar. Calendar system is based on cycles (i.e. days) rather than years.

## Celestial Satellites

Yanorra has two satellites. Their competing gravitation has made sea travel difficult -- an issue amplified by The Drift.

* **Serya** – Larger moon, stable, linked to timekeeping and tradition.
* **Mirelda** – Smaller, erratic moon associated with misfortune and tidal chaos.

## Local Star

Yanorra orbits a single star called the **Ember Mother** which has a slight red hue. The Ember Mother has remained stable since The Drift. 

# Geography

The known world consists of two main continents: **East Yanorra** and **West Yanorra**, separated by the **Veloku Ocean**. Each continent contains several nations and loosely organized regions.

## Historical Context

The existence of other continents or landmasses is a subject of debate. Numerous myths and stories describe lands beyond the known world, most originating shortly before The Drift, when oceanic exploration was still possible.

**Erik the Explorer** was a renowned traveler who claimed to have journeyed beyond the Eastvoid Ocean, returning with unusual artifacts, wildlife, and plants from a place he called **Aunqara**.

A group known as the **Aunqaran** is said to have accompanied Erik back and settled in Velu and other areas of the known world. Today, the existence of Aunqara, and the origination of the Aunqaran, is widely disputed and considered by many to be a myth. The Aunqaran themselves are now a small, insular group, concentrated in Velu, and claim to maintain cultural ties to Aunqara.

Since The Drift, several attempts to cross the Eastvoid Ocean in search of Aunqara have ended in failure, with no one returning.

### The Three Sisters

The Three Sisters are a group of three nations located in southern Eanorra. The name __Three Sisters__ comes from pre-Drift ruler, Kind Aputoku, who ruled all of Eanorra and gifted his three daughters (Ende, Obe, and Tsue) with the lands that would each become their own nation. 

In the modern era, the three nations share culture and language, as well as resources. Free trade exists between the three nations, though they remain politically independent. 

## The Brooding Sea
- Sea separating Eanorra and Wanorra, with Thornbelt in the north acting as a land bridge between the two sub-continents.
- Cold, unstable waters with large swells and unpredictable storms
- Given the relative proximity of East-West Yanorra and West-West Yanorra, the Brooding Sea is considered a dangerous barrier to maritime travel. Less than 200 miles apart at its narrowest point, only about 20% of ships attempting to cross the Brooding Sea survive the journey.

## Aunqara
- Mythical land beyond the Eastvoid Ocean.
- Believed to hold relics, knowledge, or salvation.
- No confirmed sightings.

## Veloku Ocean
- Large ocean separating East Yanorra (Velu) from West Yanorra (Duvessa).
- Ships have not been able to navigate it since The Drift.
- Travel from West Yanorra to East Yanorra now requires a stop in the Riftlands.

## Eastvoid Ocean
- Ocean separating East Yanorra from the mythical land of Aunqara.

## Westvoid Ocean

(TBD)

# Calendar System (Post-Drift)

- Time is measured in planetary rotations ("cycles").
- Traditional years are no longer used. Instead, time is logged in:
    - 1 cycle   = day
    - 1 decara  = 10 cycles
    - 1 centara = 100 cycles
    - 1 milarna = 1,000 cycles
- Dates are recorded in the format: **centara.decara.day**  
  Example: `142.22.8` = 142,228 days since The Drift
- The current date is approximately `146.10.0` (146,100 days since The Drift)

# Geopolitics

## Duvessa-Velu Sea Trade
- Goods flow from **Port Sable** (mainland Duvessa) to **Sabletown** (on Sable Island in the Riftlands).
- Most ships stop in **Sabletown** before heading east or west.
- Velu's **Gate Thaurin** is the only sanctioned port for Velu-bound ships.

# World Technology

## Communication
- No cell towers or internet infrastructure ever developed.
- Handheld devices function via packet radio or shortwave relays.
- Signal range is limited to line-of-sight or tower bounce.
- Interference is common; messages are delayed or lost.

## Power
- Electricity is sparse and unreliable.
- Sources: solar panels, wind-up generators, diesel (rare).
- Kerosene, firewood, and candles are still in daily use.

## Transportation
- No airplanes or helicopters exist.
- Oceanic ships are limited to coastal or short-island routes.
- No vessels capable of transoceanic navigation.
- Steam and diesel engines power trawlers and ferries.

## Computing
- Computers euivalent to those of the late 80s and early 90s exist
- A basic Internet-like system does exists -- think Compuserve
- Mechanical tools, analog radios, and paper systems dominate.
- Film photography exists but is uncommon due to scarcity of materials.

# The Drift
* The Drift was a cataclysmic event that altered the planet's orbit and climate.
* It caused widespread environmental upheaval, leading to the collapse of many civilizations.
* The Drift's effects are still felt today, with unpredictable weather patterns and seasonal changes, as well as a general decline in societal mental health, leading to a pervasive sense of hopelessness and despair.
